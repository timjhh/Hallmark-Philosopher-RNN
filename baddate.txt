2 2 EXT. RICHARDS REVIEW OFFICES - NIGHT
Establishing shot of the offices of the Richardson Review,
located in an old warehouse turned into modern office space.
3 3 INT. ALLISON’S OFFICE - NIGHT *
The office of the head of the Richards Review is sleekly *
elegant and no-nonsense. Two people are in the guest chairs *
in front of a large desk. *
One is LEIGH RYNESS (late 20's), wholesome and pretty but *
seems to go out of her way to hide that. Seated in the other *
is ERIN WEATHERLY, She is late 20s, cute in a bookish way. *
Erin glances at her watch nervously. *
ERIN *
Where is Allison? You’re going to *
be late. *
LEIGH *
Erin, relax. The restaurant is *
right around the corner. I have *
plenty of time. *
ERIN *
(overly enthusiastic) *
Leigh, you have to go home and *
change first. Take the blue *
sweater from my closet. Oh! And *
the yellow silk blouse. Blue *
sweater, yellow silk blouse, you *
can't go wrong. *
LEIGH
What's wrong with what I'm wearing?
ERIN
You're going on a date. Your first
date since you broke up with...
Leigh puts her hands over her ears, as if to say “I can’t *
hear you!” *
LEIGH *
Ahhh! Don’t say it. *
ERIN
Since you broke up with He Who
Shall Not Be Named.
Leigh puts down her hands. *
LEIGH
Thank you.
ERIN
You should look like you're at
least trying. Not trying too hard.
Trying just the right amount. Oh *
this is so exciting. Why aren’t *
you more excited? *
LEIGH
Because it’s my first date since I *
broke up with... *
They both put their hands to their ears as if to say “I can’t *
hear you.” *
LEIGH (CONT’D) *
I’m just keeping expectations low. *
Their boss ALLISON RICHARDS comes into the office and sits *
behind the desk. She is in her 40s and is as sleekly elegant *
and no-nonsense as her office. *
LEIGH (CONT’D) *
Hi, Allison. *
ALLISON *
Sorry I’m late. I was stuck on a *
call with some advertisers *
explaining how The Richards Review *
is a serious, hard-hitting online *
news magazine that deserves *
respect. *
(deep breath) *
But now I’m here and my full *
attention is on you two as you are *
pitching me ideas for... *
LEIGH *
(meekly) *
The Bad Date Chronicles. *
ERIN *
(same) *
The Foodie Nation Blog. *
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 2.
ALLISON *
(beat - breath) *
A serious online news magazine that *
also has a softer, human side. *
What have you got? *
Leigh and Erin prepare to start their pitches. *
4 4 EXT. PETERS POST OFFICES - NIGHT *
Establishing shot of the Peters Post headquarters, which is *
similar to the Richards Review building. *
INT. MILO’S OFFICE - NIGHT *
The office of the head of The Peters Post is much more casual *
than Allison’s, guy-centric complete with a basketball hoop *
on the door. *
CONNER McMILLAN, 30, is cute, well-groomed, and stylishly *
dressed and checking his look in a mirror on the wall. BRAD *
IRWIN, a jock in his early 30s, is very casually dressed in *
ratty jeans and a T-shirt and is shooting a Nerf style ball *
into the hoop. *
BRAD *
Conner, all I’m saying is I think *
you’re over-dressed. *
CONNER *
It’s our first date. *
BRAD *
Exactly. You’re setting the bar *
way too high. Start like that and *
by your third date you’ll need a *
tuxedo. *
CONNER *
Brad, she knows I’m the Styles and *
Trends editor for The Peters Post. *
I have to look good. I can’t show *
up wearing ratty jeans and a T- *
shirt. *
Brad looks down at his own clothes. *
BRAD *
Hey! I look good. *
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 2A.
CONNER *
For the editor of the sports blog, *
yeah. *
Their boss MILO PETERS enters drinking a cup of coffee, which *
he sets on his desk. He is in his forties, handsome, and *
casual but very competitive. *
MILO *
Conner and Brad! My two favorite *
editors. *
CONNER *
You say that to all the editors, *
Milo. *
MILO *
Yes, I do. But with you two I *
actually mean it. Just don’t tell *
Susan on the news desk. It’ll *
break her heart. Conner, looking *
good, my friend. *
CONNER *
(point proven) *
Thank you. *
(to Brad) *
See? *
BRAD *
Milo, don’t you think he’s over- *
dressed for a first date? *
MILO *
No. The Style guy has to look *
stylish. Otherwise he’s the sports *
guy. *
Conner laughs. Brad isn’t amused. *
BRAD *
Ha ha. I still say you’re going to *
regret wearing those nice clothes. *
Brad shoots the basketball at the hoop but it goes awry, *
hitting the cup of coffee, which in turn spills all over *
Conner. There is a moment of silence while they all look at *
Conner’s ruined clothes. *
BRAD (CONT’D) *
(meekly) *
Told ya. *
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 2B.
Brad tries a weak smile. This time it’s Conner that isn’t *
amused. *
INT. ALLISON’S OFFICE - NIGHT *
Leigh and Erin are pitching stories to Allison. *
ALLISON *
(to Erin) *
Erin, let’s bump the Top 10 *
Barbecue places to this week. *
Those lists are click bait. *
ERIN *
Got it. *
ALLISON *
Leigh? *
LEIGH *
I’ve got two really good *
submissions to lead on this week’s *
Bad Date Chronicles. One is from *
Becky, whose date showed up with *
his mother. The second is from *
Steven, who forgot to put the car *
in park and it rolled into the *
lake. *
ALLISON *
That is a tough choice but... let’s *
go with the car in the lake. It’ll *
make a better headline. *
LEIGH *
Okay, we’ll put the mom story below *
the fold. *
ERIN *
It’s so depressing. You know what *
we need? A True Love blog to *
balance out your Bad Date *
Chronicles. *
ALLISON *
True love? We don’t do fiction *
here at The Richards Review. *
LEIGH *
She’s right, Erin. Nobody believes *
in that hearts and flowers stuff *
anymore. *
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 2C.
ERIN *
Says the woman who is going out on *
a date tonight. *
ALLISON *
A date? Oh, then I better let you *
get out of here so you can go home *
and change. *
ERIN *
(to Leigh) *
See? *
(to Allison) *
She's got a date with the style and *
trends editor... *
Leigh tries to stop her. *
LEIGH *
Erin!! *
ERIN *
...over at the Peters Post. *
ALLISON *
(angry) *
The Peters Post? *
LEIGH *
(to Erin) *
Now you did it. *
They wait for the barrage. *
5 5 INT. MILO’S OFFICE - NIGHT *
Back in Milo’s office, Conner is now wearing the ratty jeans *
and T-shirt that Brad was wearing and Brad is in his gym *
clothes - shorts and a basketball jersey - looking at *
Conner’s phone. Milo is at his desk. *
CONNER *
I can’t go on a date like this!
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 2D.
BRAD
Why not?
CONNER
I look like a roadie for a hair
metal band.
BRAD
Maybe she likes music.
MILO *
Why don’t you just go home and *
change? *
CONNER *
I don’t have time. The restaurant *
is all the way across town so I’m *
already going to be late. How’s my *
phone? *
BRAD *
(hands it back to Conner) *
Coffee got it, too. It’s *
flickering on and off. Sorry, *
dude. *
MILO *
Use the one on the desk. *
CONNER *
Her number is my contacts. *
BRAD *
Just explain it to her. You’ll
probably have a good laugh over it.
CONNER
Brad, she edits a column called The *
Bad Date Chronicles. I show up *
looking like this and I’m going to *
be on the front page. *
MILO *
The Bad Date Chronicles? Wait, *
wait, wait. Isn’t that on The *
Richards Review? *
BRAD *
Uh-oh. *
MILO *
Do not get me started about Allison *
Richards! *
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 3-5.
QUICK CUT TO: *
8 8 INT. RICHARDS REVIEW OFFICES HALLWAY - NIGHT
Leigh and Erin are being followed by Allison down the hall.
ALLISON
You know who Milo Peters stole his
entire idea from, don't you?
Leigh and Erin have heard this rant before.
LEIGH
You.
ALLISON
Me! I hired him. I trained him.
I mentored him! And then he
stabbed me in the back and went off
to do that ridiculous Peters Post. *
QUICK CUT TO:
9 9 INT. PETERS POST OFFICES HALLWAY - NIGHT
Milo is following Brad and Conner *
MILO
She still tells people that I stole
the idea for The Peters Post from
her. Like the idea of doing an
online magazine is some brilliant
thing that nobody ever thought of.
CONNER *
I am so late! *
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 6.
MILO *
Conner, do not give this woman any *
ammunition to use against you on
her Bad Date Chronicles.
(looks at him)
Any more ammunition.
CONNER
Thank you. I feel much better now.
He turns and rushes off. Brad and Milo watch him go.
BRAD
This is not going to end well.
MILO
(shakes his head)
Dead man walking.
They nod and head in opposite directions.
10 10 INT. RICHARDS REVIEW OFFICES HALLWAY - NIGHT
Leigh, Erin, and Allison nearing the end of the hall.
ALLISON
Don't reveal any company secrets.
But get him to reveal his.
LEIGH
I just want to get out of this *
alive.
ERIN
Oh stop. It'll be fine. You won't
wind up on the Bad Date Chronicles!
QUICK CUT TO:
11 11 INT. LEIGH AND ERIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Erin is sitting on the couch watching TV as Leigh comes in.
Her hair is all wet, as is the now ruined yellow silk blouse,
and the sleeve of the blue sweater looks as though it has
been burned partially away.
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 7.
ERIN
What happened?!
Leigh sits by Erin on the couch.
LEIGH
You aren’t going to believe this...
QUICK CUT TO:
12 12 EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Leigh is standing out in front of a nice restaurant in the
yellow blouse and blue sweater. She looks at her watch.
LEIGH (V.O.)
First, he’s late. Really late.
ERIN (V.O.)
And he didn't call you?
LEIGH (V.O.)
No. I was just getting ready to
leave when he rushes up...
Conner rushes up wearing the bad t-shirt and ratty jeans. We
see him explaining but continue to hear Leigh and Erin.
ERIN (V.O.)
I thought he was the style editor.
LEIGH (V.O.)
He said something about coffee and *
switching clothes with his friend. *
We switch focus to Conner and Leigh on the date.
CONNER
I'm sorry I'm late. I would've
called, but my phone died.
He shows Leigh the phone, which appears to be working fine.
LEIGH
Looks okay to me.
Conner looks at his phone, a bit confused.
ERIN (V.O.)
Why would he say that and then show
you the phone?
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 8.
LEIGH (V.O.)
I don't know. But that was just
the start of it.
Conner and Leigh head into the restaurant.
13 13 INT. RESTAURANT LOBBY - NIGHT
Conner is arguing with the Maitre 'd while Leigh stands off
to the side uncomfortably.
ERIN (V.O.)
He didn't make a reservation?
The Maitre 'd shakes his head and points.
LEIGH (V.O.)
Apparently not. We had to wait at
the bar for 45 minutes.
They head toward the bar.
14 14 INT. LEIGH AND ERIN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Leigh now has a towel and is drying her hair. The yellow
blouse and blue sweater have been replaced with a sweatshirt.
ERIN
Why didn't you go someplace else?
LEIGH
He said it was the hottest
restaurant in town and...
ERIN
Yuck. Typical trends editor.
LEIGH
Once we got to the table things
started to go okay.
ERIN
Because all great love stories
start with things going "okay."
LEIGH
You know what I mean. I didn't
feel any butterflies but he's
charming and smart. It was going
fine. And then...
Leigh shakes her head.
9.
15 15 INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Leigh and Conner are enjoying a first course - a candle burns
romantically on table between them.
CONNER
This is so good. Try it!
LEIGH
Oh, that's okay. I have plenty.
CONNER
Seriously. This is life-changing.
He holds out his plate to her just as she is reaching for her
drink. They collide and the candle falls over and heads
directly toward the sleeve of her blue sweater.
We FREEZE there for a second.
16 16 INT. LEIGH AND ERIN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Leigh holds out the charred sweater to Erin.
LEIGH
Sorry.
ERIN
He set you on fire?!
LEIGH
Yes, but in his defense he did put
me out quickly.
Erin’s eyes get big as she takes the sweater.
17 17 INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
While we don't see Leigh on fire, we see Conner's reaction.
He jumps up, grabs a pitcher of ice water from a passing
waiter, and empties it in Leigh's direction. *
18 18 INT. LEIGH AND ERIN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Leigh holds out the ruined yellow silk blouse to Erin.
LEIGH
Sorry.
Erin takes the blouse.
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 10.
19 19 INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
A singed and wet Leigh stands there in shock.
CONNER
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
LEIGH
I’m going to go find some paper
towels and... blot...
CONNER
Do you need help?
LEIGH
No, no. No... Thank you.
Leigh heads off toward the restroom.
20 20 INT. LEIGH AND ERIN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Leigh and Erin are still on the sofa.
ERIN
(tries to smile)
Well, look at it this way. You can
say you felt a spark.
LEIGH
Yeah, it's a little too soon for
fire jokes.
ERIN
(tries not to smile)
Sorry.
LEIGH
Especially since I'm not done with
the story yet.
ERIN
Don’t tell me it gets worse?
Leigh nods.
21 21 INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Leigh comes back to the table, a little less wet, still
blotting at herself with paper towels. She stops short and
we PULL BACK to reveal that Conner is not there.
11.
ERIN (V.O.)
He left?!
Leigh sits at the table.
LEIGH (V.O.)
At first I thought he was in the
bathroom. Or maybe making a call
on his "broken" phone. But he
never came back, so...
ERIN (V.O.)
No...
LEIGH (V.O.)
Yes...
A waiter approaches the table. Leigh sighs and reluctantly
hands him a credit card.
LEIGH (V.O.)
I had to pay the whole bill. *
The waiter leaves and Leigh puts her head in her hands.
22 22 INT. LEIGH AND ERIN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Leigh and Erin on the couch.
ERIN
Anything else? Did he mug you on
your way back to the car?
LEIGH
No, that's it.
ERIN
You’re going to make him reimburse
you, right? Reimburse us?
LEIGH
No. I just want to dry off, accept
the fact that I'm never going to
date again, and eat my weight in
ice cream.
ERIN
Okay, well, I'll admit that this
was not a great re-entry into the
dating pool but on the other hand
maybe it's an improvement over your
break up with...
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 12.
Again Leigh puts her hands to her ears. *
LEIGH
Ahhhh! Don’t say it. *
ERIN
(sighs)
The Worst Person Who Ever Lived. *
Leigh puts down her hands. *
LEIGH
Thank you. And how awful is it
that being set on fire is better
than my last serious relationship?
ERIN
Look at it this way: now you have
your own Bad Date Chronicle instead
of just editing other peoples’.
LEIGH
I'm not going to put this on the *
site.
ERIN
Um, yeah you are! You're going
crush every other bad date, ever.
LEIGH
It's not a competition.
ERIN
It should be, because you'd win.
Erin grabs a nearby laptop computer and hands it to Leigh. *
ERIN (CONT’D)
Come on. This is so much better *
than a car in a lake. *
Leigh looks at the laptop suspiciously but finally shrugs and
opens it to begin writing.

24 24 INT. CONNER AND BRAD’S OFFICE - DAY
Conner and Brad's office is definitely a "guy" space, *
complete with a basketball hoop on the door just like Milo’s. *
Brad is at his desk on the computer when Conner walks in. *
BRAD *
Hey! How was the big date? *
CONNER *
(sighs and sits) *
It was a disaster. *

CONNER (CONT'D)
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 14.
25 25 EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Conner rushes up to Leigh, who is outside the restaurant.
CONNER (V.O.)
My car wouldn’t start, so I take a
cab and race over there...
Leigh sees him and gives him an up and down look that clearly
indicates she is not impressed by his clothes.
LEIGH
It's okay. You look... fine...
CONNER
I'm sorry I'm late. I would've
called, but my phone died.
He takes his phone out of his pocket and glances at it - a
black screen of nothing. As he turns it toward Leigh it
flickers on.
LEIGH
Looks okay to me.
By the time Conner turns it back around to look at it, it is
back to the black screen of nothing. He is confused.
BRAD (V.O.)
Why would she say it looked fine if
it was obviously not?
CONNER (V.O.)
I don't know. But that was just
the start of it.
Conner and Leigh head into the restaurant.
26 26 INT. RESTAURANT LOBBY - NIGHT
Conner is arguing with the Maitre 'd while Leigh stands off
to the side uncomfortably.
CONNER (V.O.)
Julian, the restaurant critic, said
he was going to set up a
reservation for me at Il Tempo.
BRAD (V.O.)
And he didn't?
The Maitre 'd shakes his head and points.
15.
CONNER (V.O.)
I guess not. We waited in the bar
for at least half an hour.
27 27 INT. CONNER AND BRAD’S OFFICE - DAY
Conner and Brad.
BRAD
Why didn’t you go somewhere else?
CONNER
Because I didn’t have a car and I
wasn't going to ask her to drive.
That would've been humiliating.
Besides, when we got seated and
were able to talk, she was funny
and smart and... it wasn't bad.
BRAD
Yeah. Here's a tip. When you're
telling your buddy about the hot
date you had the night before, you
probably shouldn't include the
phrase "it wasn't bad."
CONNER
Well... it definitely got hotter...
QUICK CUT TO:
28 28 INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Once again with Leigh and Conner at the table and the candle.
CONNER
This is delicious. Try it.
LEIGH
Oh that's okay. I have plenty.
CONNER
Seriously. This is life-changing.
He holds out his plate to her just as she is reaching for her
drink. In Conner's version, it appears to be much more
Leigh's fault but still the end result is the same... the
candle falls over and heads directly toward her sleeve.
We FREEZE there for a second.
16.
29 29 INT. CONNER AND BRAD’S OFFICE - DAY
Brad is looking at him blankly.
BRAD
(beat)
She set herself on fire?
Conner nods. There is a pause and then Brad bursts out
laughing. Conner rolls his eyes
BRAD (CONT’D)
Oh man... I've had some girls try
to get out of a date with me but
none of them have ever set
themselves on fire!
He continues laughing. Conner just shakes his head.
30 30 INT. MEN’S ROOM - NIGHT
Conner comes into the private bathroom and locks the door.
CONNER (V.O.)
I’m totally freaked out now. I’m
convinced that this woman is going
to press charges against me or
something. So I go to the bathroom
to splash some water on my face...
BRAD (V.O.)
I’m sure the waiter would’ve given
you another pitcher.
CONNER (V.O.)
Shut up. So I manage to not
hyperventilate and then...
Conner goes to open the door and it won’t - it is stuck. He
pulls and pulls and finally the knob comes off in his hand.
31 31 INT. CONNER AND BRAD’S OFFICE - DAY
Conner and Brad.
BRAD
(laughing again)
You got locked in the bathroom?!
17.
CONNER
By the time I got out, she was
gone. And to make things worse...
She paid.
BRAD
Oh dude...
CONNER
I was going to call her and explain
but her contact info was in my
phone and the phone wasn’t working *
and so I just crashed and figured *
I’d deal with it this morning.
Milo runs in, out of breath, carrying a tablet computer. *
MILO *
Conner, I have been trying to call *
you for an hour! *
CONNER *
What’s going on? *
MILO *
The whole world is looking for you. *
CONNER *
What? Why? *
MILO *
Because of how your date went last *
night. *
CONNER *
How do you know how my date went? *
MILO *
The whole world knows how your date *
went. *
Milo hands Conner the tablet and we see The Bad Date *
Chronicles on it. The headline is: FIRE AND ICE. *
CONNER *
(reads) *
“He showed up an hour late looking *
like he had just come from playing *
video games in his mother’s *
basement...” Oh, no... *
MILO *
We’ve gotten calls from newspapers, *
websites, TV... *
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 18.
BRAD *
You’ve gone viral, dude! *
Brad holds up his hand for a high-five which he doesn’t get. *
CONNER *
She didn't use my name, how... *
MILO *
(grabs the tablet back) *
"My date was with Conrad, a *
lifestyle and trends editor for an *
online magazine..." It wasn't hard *
to crack the code. *
CONNER *
That is not what happened! What do *
I do?
BRAD
Change your name and move to
another state?
Conner shakes his head and starts for the door.
CONNER
I have to go talk to her. Convince
her to take it down. Post a
retraction or something.
BRAD
Excellent idea. Yes. Do that.
Brad follows him.
CONNER
Where are you going? *
BRAD
You were late to dinner and she set
herself on fire. I can’t miss what
she’s going to do for an encore.
Conner deliberates then sighs and nods. They leave. *

Conner and Brad are walking toward the Richards Review
building just as Leigh and Erin come out of it.
CONNER
Leigh?
LEIGH
(shocked)
Conner?
ERIN
Conner! You have a lot of nerve...
BRAD
He’s got nerve? She’s the one who
made up stuff about their date and
broadcast it to the world.
ERIN
Who are you?
BRAD
I’m his friend, Brad. Who are you? *
ERIN
I’m her friend, Erin.
BRAD
(angry)
Well, it’s nice to meet you, Erin.
ERIN
(ditto)
It’s nice to meet you too, Brad.
There is silence for a moment.
LEIGH
Are you two done?
They nod.
LEIGH (CONT’D)
(to Conner)
What does he mean I made stuff up?
CONNER
What you posted on your site.
That’s not how it happened.
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 19.
LEIGH
I was there. I was the one on
fire, remember?
CONNER
I feel terrible but there were
extenuating circumstances...
LEIGH
Look, I didn’t use your name...
CONNER
But everyone knows it’s me. This
could affect my job... my life! My
mother called me from Ohio to ask
what she had done wrong that made
me turn out like this.
LEIGH
(feels a little bad)
Oh, really? I’m sorry...
ERIN
Don’t be sorry! This was his
fault, Leigh.
BRAD
It was not his fault. You haven’t
heard his side of it.
ERIN
Well, he has a column on The Peters
Post. Why doesn’t he go see if the
truth is “trending?”
LEIGH
Oh, no, I don’t think...
BRAD
Okay, he will!
CONNER
Well, maybe we could just...
BRAD
Come on, Conner! It’s time to
fight fire with fire. See what I
did there?
Brad grabs Conner and pulls him away.
ERIN
Funny. Real funny. We’ll just see
who has the last laugh!
20.
Erin grabs Leigh and drags her away. Leigh glances back over
her shoulder to watch Conner and Brad walking away and then
Conner does the same but they don’t catch each other’s eye.

35 35 INT. CONNER AND BRAD’S OFFICE - DAY
Conner is at the computer while Brad stands behind him.
BRAD
Put something in there about how
all she could think about is
herself. “Oh, I can’t believe he
made me wait. Oh, I’m on fire.”
CONNER
I’m not going to say that.
Brad pulls out his tablet and reads from Leigh’s blog post.
BRAD
“And he didn’t call to explain what
had happened. Maybe he can’t get
good cell service in his mother’s
basement.”
Conner thinks about it for a moment and starts typing.
CONNER
“Perhaps if she had taken a minute
to listen to my side we could have
had a good story to laugh about
later but instead she jumped to
conclusions so she could have a
good story for her Chronicles now.”
BRAD
Oh, that’s good. More of that.
Brad keeps watching Conner type.

37 37 INT. LEIGH AND ERIN’S OFFICE - DAY
Erin is sitting at her computer while Leigh paces back and
forth behind her, worried, chewing a fingernail. Every few
seconds Erin hits a button on the keyboard. After the third
or fourth time, Leigh snaps.
LEIGH
Stop hitting refresh!
ERIN
Well, how else are we going to know
if he posts something?
The phone on Leigh’s desk rings. Then her cell phone rings.
Then it buzzes and rings. Then the computer dings to say a
new email has been received.
LEIGH
I think we’ll know. Refresh,
refresh, refresh!
Erin hits refresh and Leigh crowds in to read.
ERIN
Oh, no he did NOT call you selfabsorbed.
LEIGH
“...the handle came off the
bathroom door...” Well, I didn’t
know that.
ERIN
“Jumped to conclusions!?”
LEIGH
Well, he has a point, I guess.
ERIN
No, he doesn’t. He’s the bad guy.
LEIGH
If what he’s saying is true, then
there is no bad guy.
ERIN
You need to write a rebuttal.
LEIGH
No.

ERIN
You can’t let him have the last
word!
LEIGH
Yes, I can. I’m putting an end to
this right now.

is a knock on the door - Leigh is standing there. Conner
stands up quickly.
CONNER
Hey.
LEIGH
Hey. Sorry to barge in
unannounced.
CONNER
It’s okay. How did you get back
here?
LEIGH
The receptionist read both of our
columns. She’s taking my side.
CONNER
(smiles)
Got it. Do you want to sit...
LEIGH
No, that’s okay, I just... Listen,
I read your post. You were
actually nicer about the whole
thing than I thought you’d be.
CONNER
I called you self-absorbed and
clueless.
LEIGH
Well, I called you vain and
entitled, so...

I just wanted to apologize for
jumping to conclusions about what
happened. I should’ve let you
explain.
CONNER
It’s okay. And I apologize for...
well, everything.
LEIGH
Apology accepted.
She holds out her hand.
LEIGH (CONT’D)
Truce?
He shakes it.
CONNER
Truce.
LEIGH
Okay... So I’m going to go back to
chronicling other people’s bad
dates...
CONNER
And I’ll go back to writing about
the latest trendy thing that
everyone will forget about by
tomorrow afternoon.
LEIGH
And we can both just forget this
ever happened.
CONNER
Sounds like a plan to me.

LEIGH
Well... I better go.

It was fine. We made peace.
ERIN
You’re a much better person than I
am because I’m still ready for war.
Nobody messes with my friends. *
I’ve been replying to comments on
his post for hours just to try to
work out some aggression.
LEIGH
Just let it go. If I can, you can.
Leigh shuts the laptop for Erin and heads out of the room.
ERIN
You’re right. Absolutely right.
Erin sits there for a moment and then opens the laptop again.
LEIGH (O.S.)
You’ve already opened the laptop
again, haven’t you?
ERIN

Yeah.
Erin reads one aloud, quietly to herself.

You still answer your own phone,
huh? Trying to prove you’re a
woman of the people, Allison?
Allison knows who it is instantly and isn’t pleased.
ALLISON
Milo Peters! How are things over
at that little blog of yours?
MILO
Not so little anymore. One of our
posts just hit 15 million views.
ALLISON
(tries to be cool)
Really? I didn’t know that many
people in your target audience
could read.
MILO
(smiles)
About a million more than yours,
apparently. Seems like people are
siding with my Trends guy over your
Bad Date woman.
ALLISON
No accounting for taste.
MILO
(laughs)
Same old Allison. Beautiful but
ruthless.
ALLISON
(rolls her eyes)
Same old, Milo. Do women actually
fall for that kind of line?
MILO
You did.
Allison sits up straight and looks around as if someone could
overhear.
ALLISON
(whispers)
Once. We went out on one date and
it was horrible.
27.
MILO
It wasn’t that bad.
ALLISON
I’ve had surgery that wasn’t as
painful. Can I help you with
something, Milo?
MILO
Actually I was thinking we could
help each other.
ALLISON
(beat)
I’m listening.
MILO
It’s obvious that these posts are
connecting with people. I’m not
going to lie, 15 million is the
biggest thing we’ve ever seen and I
figure 14 million is for you, too.
ALLISON
I can neither confirm or deny that.
MILO
You just confirmed it by saying
that. So it seems like it’s in our
mutual best interest to find a way
to keep this going.

guessing.
ALLISON

I don’t come here every day.
MILO
Allison, please. I worked with you
every day for two years, do you
think there’s anything I don’t know
about you?
ALLISON
What do you want, Milo?
MILO
Just checking in, seeing if you’re
ready for the big date tonight.
ALLISON
(nonchalant)
Oh, is that tonight?
MILO
(smiles)
Why yes, yes it is. Let me guess.
You had forgotten all about it.
ALLISON
Totally slipped my mind.
MILO
Okay, well, maybe we need to make
it a little more interesting for
you then.
ALLISON

I was thinking a little wager.
Whoever gets the most post views
wins.
ALLISON
Wins what?
MILO
(sits back)
One dollar.
ALLISON
Times a little tough over at The
Peters Post?
MILO
It’s symbolic. I think losing will
make you crazy no matter how much
it is.
ALLISON
(beat)
Okay. You’re on.
They shake on it.
MILO
But no interference.
ALLISON
What do you mean?
MILO
It’s in both of our interest for
these dates to go poorly but
whatever happens, happens. We stay
out of it.
ALLISON
(nods)
Deal. Do you know where they’re
going tonight?
MILO
It’s the do-over date so they’re
going back to the scene of the
crime - Il Tempo.
ALLISON
Whose idea was that?
Milo just smiles and gets up to leave.
35.
MILO
I’d like my dollar to be a crisp,
new bill please.

CONNER (CONT’D)
Which tie?
BRAD
For what? The job interview you’re
going to have to go on if you mess
this thing up?
CONNER
How is that helpful?
Brad points at one of the ties and then goes to sit at the
kitchen table while Conner tries to use his reflection in the
toaster to tie it.
BRAD
Try to relax. Just be yourself.
CONNER
You think that’ll work?

BRAD
Oh no. It’s going to be a train
wreck. But at least you’ll have
something good to write about
afterward.
CONNER
You always know just what to say.
BRAD
Look, maybe if absolutely nothing
else, you just view this as
practice, you know? It’s been a
long time since Amy.
That name visibly affects Conner.
CONNER
It takes awhile to get over having
your heart stomped on.
BRAD
But now you’re dating, so that’s
progress.
CONNER
I’m not dating. I’m being forced
by my boss to go to dinner with a
woman.
(joking)
I feel so cheap.
BRAD
Okay, yeah, this one is a bit weird
but the first one... that was a
real date.

Okay. I’m ready. Wish me luck.
BRAD
You don’t need luck.
CONNER

Really? Thanks, man.

Oh. Right. Sorry. Never mind. *
LEIGH
I can’t believe I’m so nervous.
It’s not even a real date.
ERIN
It’s kind of a real date. He’s
taking you to dinner.
LEIGH
Only because someone is paying us
to do it. I’m pretty sure this is
illegal in certain states.
ERIN
I’m sure it’ll be fine. Who knows,
maybe you’ll even have some fun.
LEIGH
Fun? On a date? Does that ever *
happen? *
ERIN
Wow, he really did a number on you,
didn’t he?

Leigh has made a couple of times to keep Erin from saying her
ex-boyfriend’s name.
ERIN
Ahhh! Don’t say it! *
LEIGH
Oh. Yeah.
(beat)
He broke my heart. No. More than
that. He made me feel... like I
wasn’t good enough.
Erin comes out of the kitchen to go to Leigh and take her
hands.
ERIN
But you are, you know? You’re
better than good enough. You’re
amazing.
LEIGH
(beat)
Stop it. You’re going to make my
mascara run and you know how much I
hate female cliches.
The two of them embrace and then Leigh heads for the door. *

Oh yes, sir. Here it is. A table

MAITRE ‘D
No, sir. It was at 7:30 but it was
moved to 9:45.
CONNER
By who?
MAITRE ‘D
I don’t know, sir.
Conner turns away from the man in frustration and his gaze
comes to land on Leigh.
CONNER

Ohhhhh... trying to tank the date,
huh? Okay. Okay...
He turns back to the Maitre ‘d as he pulls out his wallet.

either?

No! And this time I meant to say
it emphatically.
CONNER

Well, hey! Look at that. We have
things in common. Neither one of

I’ll drink to that.
They clink their water glasses together and smile, a little

next to her plate of pasta. This time we see the “PRIVATE *
CHAT” messages as they are happening. *
SINGLESURFER87: Well?????! *
Erin smiles and takes a bite of the pasta. Her reaction *
indicates that it is very good. She sets down the fork and *
types. *
FOODIEFAN88: Please call your mother and tell her how much I *
love her. *
SINGLESURFER87: Careful. She’s going to want to meet you *
before I get a chance to. *
Erin laughs and takes another bite. It’s really good. *
EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT *

70 70 INT. RESTAURANT LEIGH & CONNER’S TABLE - NIGHT *
They are handing their menus back to a waiter who walks away *
with their order.
CONNER
Okay. So, I guess we should do the
first date stuff that we didn’t get
to do last time.
LEIGH
Right. Like, where you’re from,
family, how long have you lived
here type stuff?
CONNER
Yeah. The basics.
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 47.
LEIGH
(smiles)
Okay, well, I’m from...
Leigh’s phone rings. She pulls it out of her purse *
LEIGH (CONT’D) *
Oh. Sorry. I forgot to turn the *
ringer off.
She shuts off the phone and returns it to her purse. *
CONNER
Go ahead.
LEIGH
Right. So I’m from...
The phone starts buzzing loudly in her purse. *
LEIGH (CONT’D) *
Sorry... Sorry... I’m just going to *
shut it off.
She does so and puts the phone back in her purse. *
LEIGH (CONT’D) *
Okay. I think we’re good now. *
CONNER
Okay. So, you were saying? *
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 47A.
LEIGH
Yes. I was just going to say that
I’m from...
The Maitre ‘d walks up to the table.
MAITRE ‘D
Ms. Ryness? There’s a call for you *
at the front desk.
LEIGH *
Really? Okay... *
(to Conner) *
I better...
CONNER *
(smiles) *
Yeah, of course. Go ahead.
Leigh gets up and goes with the Maitre ‘d. *
71 71 INT. RESTAURANT LOBBY - CONTINUOUS *
The Maitre ‘d walks Leigh to the front desk and hands her the *
phone receiver.
Milo walks into the lobby at the same time and lurks in the
background so he can listen to what is happening.
LEIGH *
Hello? Hello? *
She hands the phone back to the Maitre ‘d. *
LEIGH (CONT’D) *
There’s nobody there. *
MAITRE ‘D
Really? There was just a moment
ago. He said he was your brother *
and it was urgent.
LEIGH *
I don’t have a brother. *
(beat - realization)
(MORE)
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 48.
I don’t suppose his name was Brad *
was it?
MAITRE ‘D
He didn’t give a name. *
Leigh looks back at the table where Conner is sitting. *
LEIGH *
(suspicious - to herself) *
So... you need this to be a bad *
date, too, huh? I’m on to you, *
buddy. *
She walks back toward the table. *
72 72 INT. RESTAURANT ALLISON AND MILO’S TABLE - CONTINUOUS *
Allison comes back to the table and sits down with a cat that
ate the canary grin. Milo comes back as well.
MILO
Call from his brother, hmmmm? What *
did you do, disguise your voice? *
ALLISON
(smiles as she talks in a *
low voice) *
I have no idea what you’re talking
about.
MILO
Okay. This means war.
Milo matches her grin.
73 73 DATE MONTAGE OF SCENES #1
A series of dialogue free scenes follows that quickly show
the progression of the really bad date, with most of the bad
being caused by Allison and Milo.
1) Milo bumps a waiter and the waiter bumps into Leigh,
causing her to spill her drink into Conner’s lap.
2) Allison pours most of a salt container into a dish that is
on its way to Leigh and Conner’s table.
3) Milo standing by the kitchen with a bottle of Tabasco *
sauce, smiling, while in the background, Conner is drinking *
big gulps of water as if his mouth is on fire. *
LEIGH (CONT'D)

74 74 INT. RESTAURANT LEIGH & CONNER’S TABLE - CONTINUOUS
The date is almost over and Leigh and Conner look relieved.
LEIGH
Well, this has been...
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 49A.
CONNER
Yeah. Just...
LEIGH
Maybe we should...
CONNER
I think so...
Conner signals for the waiter that he wants the check.
CONNER (CONT’D)
Well, look at it this way. At
least nothing burst into flames
this time.
The Maitre ‘d wheels a cart up to the table - it has a pan
with a lid on it.
MAITRE ‘D
Sir, as requested, Our signature
dessert...
CONNER
Dessert?
LEIGH
Dessert?
We ZOOM past the dessert cart to Allison and Milo’s table.
MILO
Dessert?
ALLISON
(smiles)
Dessert.
Back at Leigh and Conner’s table, the Maitre ‘d pulls the lid
off the pan.
MAITRE ‘D
Cherries Jubilee!
There is a whoosh of flame.
QUICK CUT TO:
75 75 INT. LEIGH AND ERIN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Erin is on the couch, happily trading messages with
SingleSurfer87 when the door opens. Leigh comes in, wet,
singed, and limping because of a broken heel.

Erin looks at her in horror.
LEIGH
Get the ice cream ready while I
change.
Erin nods and runs toward the kitchen.

Brad and Milo are looking over Conner’s shoulder as they read
the Bad Date Chronicles.
BRAD
(reads)
“I’m not 100% sure but I think he
might be trying to kill me. I
should check my will to make sure
he’s not a beneficiary.”
(laughs)
Wow. This is worse than the
original.
CONNER
I didn’t order that dessert!
MILO
This is so great!
CONNER
Great? How is this great?
MILO
Because your version already has
twice the number of hits as hers
does. We’re winning! Totally
worth the effort.
CONNER
What effort?
MILO
(making it up as he goes)
The effort... it took... to build
this company and hire brilliant
editors like you. Nicely done! *
Milo pats Conner on the back and leaves quickly.
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 51.
CONNER
That was weird.
BRAD
This is weird. In your blog you
say...
(reads)
“I have no way of proving that she
set up fake calls to pull her away *
from the table, but if the Bad Date *
plot fits, wear it.”
(looks at him)
You really think she had her
roommate page her at the front *
desk?
CONNER
I don’t know who else it could’ve
been.
They continue reading.
78 78 INT. MILO’S OFFICE - DAY
Milo walks into his office and picks up the phone, dialing
quickly.
MILO

He smiles.
79 79 EXT. RICHARDS REVIEW OFFICES - DAY

80 80 INT. LEIGH AND ERIN’S OFFICE - DAY
Leigh and Erin are at their desks, reading the blogs and
comments.
ERIN
MyraB wants to know why Conner
hates women.
LEIGH
Who’s Myra B?
ERIN
One of the people commenting on
your article.
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 52.
LEIGH
Why are you reading those?
Everyone who posts on there is
crazy.
ERIN
(offended)
They’re not all crazy.
LEIGH
Well, I’ll tell you what is crazy:
that Conner really thinks I did all
this stuff just to make the date go
badly. Why would he say that?
ERIN
I think the operative word in the
title “Bad Date Chronicles” is bad.
Besides, you said that’s what HE
did.
LEIGH
I know that’s what he did.
ERIN
(shrugs)
Maybe he’s trying to divert
suspicion.
LEIGH
This is so ridiculous. I went
through all that and he’s getting
more views on his post than I am.
ERIN
How’s Allison taking it?
LEIGH
She’s ready to explode. If I don’t
get the page views up somehow, I
don’t know what she’s going to do.
QUICK CUT TO:
81 81 INT. ALLISON’S OFFICE - DAY
Allison on the other end of the call we saw a moment ago.
ALLISON
Double or nothing? Deal!
She smiles and disconnects the call.

82 82 EXT. RICHARDS REVIEW OFFICES - DAY
It’s a new day at the Richards Review.
83 83 EXT. RICHARDS REVIEW OFFICES ROOFTOP - DAY
Erin is at one of the tables eating lunch and on her tablet
computer chatting with SingleSurfer87. We see their “PRIVATE *
CHAT”: *
SINGLESURFER87: I have to run. Are you going to be online
tonight?
FOODIEFAN88: I should be. 8? *
SINGLESURFER87: It’s a date.
Erin smiles at the idea of that and disconnects the chat just
as Brad comes out on to the roof.
BRAD
Hey... the front desk said I could
come up... I’m Brad... Conner’s *
friend? *
ERIN
I remember who you are. If you’re *
looking for Leigh, she’s not... *
BRAD *
I’m not here to talk to Leigh. I’m *
here to talk to you. *
ERIN *
Why? *
BRAD
Because you’re the one helping *
Leigh tank their dates.
ERIN
I am not!
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 54.
BRAD
So that wasn’t you calling to pull *
her away from the table? *
ERIN
No!
BRAD
Uh-huh.
ERIN
Why are you here?
BRAD
Because their second date is
tonight and I’m asking you to stay
out of it.
ERIN
I’m not in it! Maybe you should
stay out of it. Conner couldn’t *
have done all that by himself. *
BRAD
Look, I know you don’t like Conner,
but he’s actually a really good
guy. And... he’s been hurt, okay?
His last relationship was...
(shakes his head)
It took him a long time to get to
where he felt like he could trust
anyone and so... Just stay out of
it, okay?
He turns and heads for the door.
ERIN
Leigh was hurt, too.
Brad stops.
ERIN (CONT’D)
So bad that she won’t even let me
say his name around her. The Bad
Date Chronicles is more than just a
job for her. It’s her way of
feeling a little less... alone.
BRAD
(beat)
I’m sorry to hear that.
ERIN
I’m sorry, too. For him.
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 55.
BRAD
Just let them have their date,
okay?
He leaves before Erin can protest anymore.
84 84 EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
Establishing shot of the coffee shop we saw earlier.
85 85 INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
Allison is back in her usual spot having her usual cup of
coffee. Milo joins her.
ALLISON
I really need to find a new place
to get coffee.
MILO *
When are you going to let go of
this feud between us?
ALLISON
When you admit what you did.
MILO
What did I do?
ALLISON
You know.
MILO
What? Starting my company?
Wanting to have something I could
call my own? This is what you’re
angry about for the last two years?
ALLISON
What do you want, Milo? *
MILO
(shakes his head)
Okay, here’s the deal. I was re- *
reading the blog postings - both of *
them - and I’m actually feeling a *
little bit...
(MORE)
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 56.
I don’t know, let’s call it guilty,
about what we did.
ALLISON
(eyebrow arch)
You? Guilty?
(looks around)
Is this being filmed for one of
those prank videos?
MILO
I’m serious. Our sites may not be
The New York Times, but we still
should have a modicum of
journalistic integrity, don’t you
think? And messing with the love
lives of two completely innocent
people just for our own selfish,
personal gain is probably as far
from integrity as you can get.
ALLISON
(sighs)
I hate it when you’re right.
MILO
Okay. So, their date tonight goes
however it’s going to go, good or
bad, and we stay out of it.
Agreed?
ALLISON
Agreed.
They shake on it.
MILO
(teasing her)
You know you’re beautiful when you
compromise.
ALLISON
(annoyed)
Go away.
He smiles and does just that but Allison can’t help but smile
as he walks away.

87 87 INT. LEIGH AND ERIN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Erin is on the computer as Leigh comes out from her bedroom.
LEIGH
This is insane! He’s just going to
try to mess with me again like he
did last time.
ERIN
Well, then mess with him first.
LEIGH
But then doesn’t that make me just
as bad as him?
ERIN
You have to make a choice, Leigh.
Either take control or just stay
here and hide out on the couch.
LEIGH
Our couch is really comfortable.
Erin gets up and goes to Leigh, taking her by the shoulders.
ERIN
Take control!
Leigh nods, takes a deep breath and exits, pulling the door
closed behind her.
88 88 EXT. PETERS POST OFFICES - NIGHT
Establishing shot of The Peters Post building.
89 89 INT. CONNER AND BRAD’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Conner is having a similar freak out with Brad.
BRAD
I really don’t know what you’re so
freaked out about.
CONNER
I’m going out on a date with
someone who thinks I’m trying to
kill her.
58.
BRAD
She doesn’t really think that. She
just thinks you’re trying to
sabotage your dates. And you know
what? Maybe you should.
CONNER
What? Why?
BRAD
Because otherwise you’re just going
to be playing defense all night.
Don’t let her take advantage of you
like...
Brad trails off.
CONNER
(beat)
Like Amy did.
Brad nods and pats Conner on the back.
CONNER (CONT’D)
(nods)
No more playing defense.
He heads toward the door.
90 90 EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT
The sidewalk outside of a movie theater is mostly empty as
Conner and Leigh rush up to each other from opposite
directions.
CONNER AND LEIGH
Sorry I’m late.
LEIGH
I just got here.
CONNER
So did I.
LEIGH
So we’re both late?
CONNER
And we missed the start of the
movie.
They are both very wary and mistrustful of one another.
59.
LEIGH
Okay... so what’s plan B?
CONNER
Well, I was thinking maybe we could
take one of those paddle boat rides
out on the lake?
LEIGH
Lake? No. No lakes, especially if
there’s a car involved. *
CONNER
What?
LEIGH
Never mind. What if we just went
to get some coffee?
CONNER
Coffee, huh? A room full of hot
liquids. I don’t think so.
There’s a little bar around the
corner that does karaoke.
LEIGH
(eyes wide)
So I can make a fool out of myself
in public? No, thank you. Roller
skating?
CONNER
So I can wind up in a cast?
LEIGH
Well, then what are we going to do?
CONNER
(exasperated)
Should we just go take a walk?
LEIGH
A walk?
CONNER
Yeah, you know... one foot in front
of the other.
LEIGH
(very suspicious)
Okay.
CONNER
Okay.
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 60.
They start walking, looking at each other out of the corner
of their eyes, waiting for the other to do something that
will turn this into a Bad Date Chronicle.

Establishing shot of Leigh and Erin’s apartment.
92 92 INT. LEIGH AND ERIN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Erin is sitting on the couch chatting with SingleSurfer
again. We see their exchange...
FOODIEFAN88: I’m not a big pop music fan. I prefer ‘60s soul *
music.
SINGLESURFER87: OK, just when I was sure you couldn’t be any
more perfect. Soul, R&B, Motown. My favorite!
FOODIEFAN88: That’s incredible. I wonder what else we have *
in common.
SINGLESURFER87: Well... should we find out? What are you
doing for lunch tomorrow?
Erin is taken aback.
ERIN
Whoa.
FOODIEFAN88: You want to meet? Like in person? *
SINGLESURFER87: That’s the way meeting usually works.
Erin contemplates it for a moment then takes a deep breath
and types.
FOODIEFAN88: Lunch would be great. *
SINGLESURFER87: Great! How about Grandy’s on 5th? Noon?
FOODIEFAN88: Sounds good. *
She starts to get up but then realizes...
FOODIEFAN88: Wait! How are we going to know each other? *
SINGLESURFER87: I’ll be wearing a red shirt and jeans.
FOODIEFAN88: Okay. I’ll see you at noon. *
She shuts down the chat application and smiles nervously.
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 61.
93 93 EXT. STREET - NIGHT
Conner and Leigh are walking down the street nervously and
silently.
CONNER
So... how did you get started with
the Bad Date Chronicles?
LEIGH
Happenstance, mainly. I got hired
to be a copy editor on the site but *
then I had this really, really epic
break up around the time they were
looking for someone to run the *
blog. It seemed like a natural fit *
at the time. *
CONNER *
Had a few bad dates yourself, huh? *
I mean, other than ours. *
LEIGH *
(smiles) *
Yes. Bad dates. Bad relationship. *
Bad... everything. I kind of *
wanted to just forget about it, you *
know? Work on something happy and *
upbeat, but the site didn’t have a *
blog about puppies and rainbows, *
so... How about you and Trends? *
CONNER
In a way, the same thing. I was *
writing a sports blog, had a bad
break up, and then needed something
else to write about.
LEIGH
Why?
CONNER
Oh, did I not mention she was a
sportscaster on a local TV station?
LEIGH
Ah. Continue.
CONNER
So my college buddy Brad hooked me
up with the gig at The Peters Post
by telling them I was super trendy
and cutting edge on all the latest
everything.
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 62.
LEIGH
And you weren’t?
CONNER
My car was seven years old and I’d
had the same haircut since I was
fifteen.
Leigh laughs.
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 62A.
CONNER (CONT’D)
You know that phrase “fake it ‘til
you make it?” I was really good at
faking it.
LEIGH
So I guess our breakups were good
for something. They got us jobs.
CONNER
Yeah, I guess they did. Although
there is that whole inability to
trust anyone thing to balance it
out.
LEIGH
There is that.
They smile a little at each other and keep walking.
94 94 INT. CAR - NIGHT
From inside a car we see Conner and Leigh go by. Moments
later, Allison sits up in the driver’s seat, watching them
intently. A few seconds later, someone walks up to the
passenger side and knocks on the window. Allison jumps,
startled, and then sees that it is Milo. She sighs and
unlocks the door - he jumps in.
MILO
(accusatory)
So much for integrity, huh?
ALLISON
I’m just watching. You?
MILO
Same. 15 million page views are at
stake.
ALLISON
Well, I’d forget that because the
two of them are on the most boring
date ever.
MILO
I know, right? They’re taking a
walk and talking. I mean, come on.
ALLISON
This is not Bad Date Chronicle
worthy.
63.
MILO
So what do we do? We agreed not to
interfere.
ALLISON
Yes, we did. Because that would be
bad.
MILO
Yes, it would be.
(beat)
Although...
ALLISON
(eager)
I’m listening.
MILO
A bad date is not just in our best
interest, it’s also in theirs.
ALLISON
Go on...
MILO
A bad date means more page views,
which means a higher profile for
them, which could mean better jobs,
more money...
ALLISON
This could be the first step toward
them running their own online
magazines. We kind of owe it to
them to interfere. We’re like
their mentors.
MILO
And mentors have integrity!
ALLISON
Well, then what are we waiting for?
The two of them start to get out of the car.
MILO
Allison!
ALLISON
What?
64.
MILO
You’re beautiful when you
compromise but you’re gorgeous when
you’re devious.
ALLISON
(rolls her eyes)
Can we just go ruin a date, please?
They get out of the car.
95 95 DATE MONTAGE OF SCENES #2
A series of dialogue free scenes follows that quickly show
the progression of yet another bad date.
1) Leigh is on a small stage at a bar, having been talked
into karaoke. As she is singing the words on the monitor
suddenly disappear and she is left floundering as everyone in
the audience points and laughs. We ZOOM to see Milo behind a *
curtain, holding the plug. *
2) Conner and Leigh are walking down a sidewalk with *
milkshakes. Leigh takes a sip of hers and spits it out - *
it’s horrible. They walk on by and Allison enters the shot *
with a bottle of ketchup and a smile. *
3) A sign reads “Paddle Boat Rentals” and has an arrow
pointing off. Conner and Leigh come from that direction,
very wet and very unhappy. After they walk away, Milo and *
Allison enter the shot holding a drill, looking very pleased *
with themselves. *

97 97 INT. ALLISON’S OFFICE - DAY
Allison is practically giddy while looking at her computer
when Leigh comes in.
ALLISON
Leigh! How does it feel?
LEIGH
How does what feel?
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 65.
ALLISON
To be a winner! Your write-up of
the date last night is outpacing
the Peters Post version by thirty
percent! We’re going to crush them
with the next date!
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 65A.
LEIGH
Yeah, that’s what I wanted to talk
to you about. I don’t think
there’s going to be a next date.
ALLISON
What do you mean? He’s not that *
bad, is he? *
LEIGH
No, he’s not... he actually seems *
like a pretty decent guy and we *
were even having fun in between all *
the horrible stuff that was *
happening, but Allison, I think *
another date might kill me.
Allison, puts an arm around Leigh’s shoulder. *
ALLISON
Look, Leigh, I’ve been seeing you *
in a new light since all this
started. Smart, funny, talented...
LEIGH
Wait. How did you see me before?
ALLISON
To be honest? You were fine. Fine
is fine but it’s not amazing and
since you started writing your
experiences you have been amazing.
LEIGH
Really?
ALLISON
Yes.
(reads from the computer)
“If he is not intentionally trying
to make these dates a nightmare
then I’m pretty sure one of us must
have picked up an ancient Tiki
necklace on a family trip to Hawaii
because we are cursed.”
(to Leigh)
That’s funny. I see big things for
you here at The Richards Review.
LEIGH
But can’t I write about something
else? Something that doesn’t *
involve the threat of imminent
death?
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 66.
ALLISON
I’m sure you could, but how are you
going to feel if you don’t see this
all the way through?
LEIGH
Relieved?
ALLISON
Like a quitter. You don’t want to
be a quitter, do you? I know I
don’t.
LEIGH
You don’t have as much at stake in
this as I do.
ALLISON
(considers)
You know what? You may be right. *
Allison opens the door.
ALLISON (CONT’D)
It was good talking to you Leigh.
Looking forward to the next write
up.
Allison pushes Leigh out the door and pulls it closed.

to vent.
CONNER
She thinks I sank the boat!
BRAD
I know.
CONNER
I didn’t sink the boat!
BRAD
I know. But the boat sank and so,
if I was your girlfriend...
CONNER
She’s not my girlfriend! And it’s
not my fault!
BRAD
(shrugs)
It’s gotta be someone’s fault.
CONNER
Well, it shouldn’t be me. Leigh is
trying to blame me for everything.
I didn’t break the karaoke machine,
I didn’t put ketchup in her
milkshake, and I certainly didn’t
sink the boat!
Conner sits at his desk, dejectedly.
BRAD
Do you think your girlfriend did?
CONNER
Stop calling her that! I don’t
know. She doesn’t seem like the
type but this can’t all be a
coincidence. Nobody has three
dates in a row like this by
accident.
68.
BRAD
So what are you going to do about
it?
Conner pauses for a moment and then gets up and heads for the
door.

routine.
MILO
Same coffee house, same table, just
ten minutes later than usual?
ALLISON
(offended)
I got a different drink, too.
Milo looks at it.
MILO
Looks the same to me.
ALLISON
It’s only a half-caf.
Milo shakes his head.
69.
MILO
(sardonic)
Yeah. You’re a mad woman. Totally
out of control.
ALLISON
Anyway... so I was talking to Leigh *
and she made a good point. *
MILO
What was that?
ALLISON
That I don’t have enough at stake
in this little competition of ours.
MILO
Okay. So what did you have in
mind?
Allison takes out a business card and sets it on the table.
MILO (CONT’D)
Your business card? Not sure
that’s worth more than the four
bucks we’re up to on our double or *
nothing bet, but... *
ALLISON
Not the card... the business.
MILO
What?
ALLISON
I did some research. The Richards *
Review has women 18-49. The Peters
Post has men. Separately we do
fine. But together... together we *
could be amazing.
MILO
You want us to merge?
ALLISON
Yes.
MILO
As partners?
ALLISON
Well, that’s where the wager comes
in. If we get more hits on the next
date post then you work for me.
(MORE)
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 70.
If you get more hits, then I work
for you.
MILO
You’re serious.
ALLISON
Very.
Milo considers it for a moment.
MILO
You’re on.
They shake on it.
104 104 EXT. RICHARDS REVIEW OFFICES - DAY
Leigh is coming out of the Richards Review offices just as
Conner is approaching.
LEIGH
Conner?
CONNER
I can’t believe you really think
I’m that much of a monster!
Leigh is taken aback. She looks around, nervous that other
people have overheard his outburst.
LEIGH
Do you mind? I work here.
She guides him off to the side away from other people.
LEIGH (CONT’D)
What are you talking about?
CONNER
Your Bad Date Chronicle where you
called me a sociopath.
LEIGH
I did not.
CONNER
You may as well have. Sabotage,
food tampering, maritime disasters.
I mean if I wasn’t so offended I’d
be impressed that you think I have
that much power.
ALLISON (CONT'D)
71.
LEIGH
So what? You just expect me to
believe that all of this was just
happenstance?
CONNER
No, I don’t think that at all.
LEIGH
Oh, so I’m the sociopath?
CONNER
If the straight-jacket fits...
LEIGH
It wasn’t me!
CONNER
Well, it wasn’t me either.
LEIGH
If it wasn’t you and it wasn’t me,
then who was it?
At that moment, a car pulls up to the curb at the front of
the building and Allison gets out of the passenger side.
Leigh tries to hide behind Conner.
LEIGH (CONT’D)
Oh great. That’s my boss.
Conner looks just as Milo leans across to wave goodbye to
Allison.
CONNER
That’s my boss!
Leigh looks. Allison and Milo look very chummy.
LEIGH
Wait a minute. That’s Milo Peters?
CONNER
Yes. That’s Allison Richards?
LEIGH
Yes. What are they doing together?
It takes them a moment but then it all becomes clear.
CONNER AND LEIGH
Ohhhhhhhhh!
72.
They nod as they figure out who has been sabotaging their
dates.
105 105 EXT. CAFE - DAY
Erin is sitting at a table at an outdoor cafe, nervously
drumming her fingers and looking every which way. As she
looks to her right, someone sits down at the table on her
left. When she looks back she sees Brad.
He is wearing a light jacket and also looking around.
ERIN
(not happy)
Brad?
BRAD
(ditto)
Erin?
ERIN
What are you doing here?
BRAD
I’m meeting someone.
ERIN
So am I. Go away.
BRAD
What do you mean, go away?
ERIN
I mean, you’re going to ruin it.
BRAD
How would I ruin it?
ERIN
I don’t know, but I’m sure you’ll
find a way.
BRAD
Well, then maybe you should leave.
ERIN
I’m not leaving!
BRAD
I’m not either.
To punctuate this, he takes off his jacket, revealing a red
shirt underneath.
73.
It takes Erin a moment - then she gasps and points.
ERIN
Red shirt!
He looks down at his shirt and realizes what that comment
means.
BRAD
No...
ERIN
SingleSurfer?
BRAD
FoodieFan?! *
They both gape at each other, horrified.
106 106 EXT. RICHARDS REVIEW OFFICES - DAY
Leigh and Conner are sitting on a bench outside the Richards
Review office, contemplating what they have just learned.
CONNER
It all makes sense now.
LEIGH
I was feeling so...
CONNER
Inept?
LEIGH
Yes. Like I had not only forgotten
how to date but was actually really
bad at it. Like bodily harm bad.
CONNER
I know! I mean, I realize I
shouldn’t wrap up my sense of selfworth in a stereotypical guy thing
of how women respond to me on a
date, but...
LEIGH
I get it. I totally get it. But
it wasn’t us. It was them!
CONNER
Yes. They are the sociopaths.
They sank our boat!
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 74.
LEIGH
They lit me on fire. Twice!
CONNER
(beat)
Well, once... the first time was
before they got involved.
Leigh pauses for a moment.
LEIGH
I saw we blame them anyway.
CONNER
Works for me.
LEIGH
So what are we going to do? We’re
supposed to go out again this
weekend.
CONNER
And it’s supposed to be our last
date. I don’t think I want to know
what they have in mind for a grand
finale.
LEIGH
Yeah, that’s not going to end well
for us.
CONNER
So we just tell them we’re not
going to do it.
LEIGH
I tried that already.
CONNER
Okay, then what if we tell them we
know what they’ve been doing. Tell
them to keep away from our last
date and let it happen however it’s
going to happen.
LEIGH
And you think they’ll listen?
CONNER
No, probably not.
(beat)
Unless... they can’t mess with our
date if they don’t know when the
date is happening.
75.
LEIGH
They already do.
CONNER
Not if we change it.
LEIGH
Oh. I like it. Change it to when?
CONNER
Right now. Let’s just go. Blow
off the rest of work and go off the
record. Prove to ourselves that we
aren’t Bad Date Chronicles
material.
LEIGH
(smiles)
Let’s do it!
They shake on it and then jump off the bench and scurry off
quickly.
107 107 EXT. CAFE - DAY
Brad and Erin are still sitting there, both with their arms
crossed and their backs to one another.
ERIN
Did you know?
BRAD
Know what?
ERIN
That I was me? That she was me?
The one you were chatting... you
know what I mean.
BRAD
No. We talked about Leigh and
Conner’s dates and you never said
anything about knowing them.
ERIN
I wanted to know what you really
thought and figured if you knew I
knew her, you’d censor your
answers.
BRAD
Yeah. Me too. *
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 76.
Turns to him.
ERIN
But you defended Leigh online. *
BRAD
I didn’t want to admit that I *
thought my friend was being... *
ERIN
Lame? *
BRAD
(shrugs)
Something like that. I read both *
sides and I kind of felt like Leigh
was making a stronger case. Don’t
tell her I said that.
ERIN
I won’t... if you don’t tell him *
that I saw his side of things, too. *
BRAD *
Why didn’t you say so in our chats? *
ERIN *
Because she’s my friend. It’s in *
the job description to defend her. *
BRAD *
I get it. *
ERIN
So now what? Because as much as I
may have liked you as SingleSurfer,
you in person has been...
BRAD
Yeah, the feeling is mutual.
ERIN
Well, I guess that’s that, then. *
BRAD
I guess so.
Neither of them move.
ERIN
The universe has a really lousy
sense of humor.
Brad nods but they still don’t move.

109 109 EXT. STREET - DAY
Leigh and Conner are walking down the street, laughing and
eating ice cream cones.
LEIGH
(laughs)
No way. Seriously?
CONNER
(nods)
Yep. When I was little I wanted to
be the Governor of Ohio.
LEIGH
Not President?
CONNER
No! That’s too scary. You have to
deal with things like war. The
Governor of Ohio gets all the cool
stuff the president does like the
car and the bodyguards and the code
name but he never has to worry
about whether or not Michigan is
going to attack.
LEIGH
That’s a good point.
CONNER
What did you want to be when you
grew up?
LEIGH
(rolls her eyes)
Oh, I did the little girl trifecta:
princess, ballerina, or doggy
doctor.
CONNER
Nice!
LEIGH
Yeah, but unfortunately I learned I
wasn’t born into royalty, I have
two left feet, and our dog Skipper
didn’t go live on a farm upstate.
(MORE)
78.
The bloom was off the rose on all
of them.
CONNER
Understandable.
There is a silence between that is much more friendly and
comfortable than any of the previous ones have been. *
CONNER (CONT’D)
Can I ask you a question?
LEIGH
Of course.
CONNER
If our first date hadn’t crashed
and burned...
LEIGH
I see what you did there.
CONNER
...would you have wanted to go out
with me again?
LEIGH
(smiles - embarrassed)
I think so.
CONNER
Why?
LEIGH
Because I thought you were nice.
Despite everything that happened, *
for some reason I couldn’t stop
thinking that you were a nice guy. *
I didn’t get a lot of... nice... *
with my ex-boyfriend, so... nice *
was... a nice change of pace. *
CONNER
Well, I was relieved when I thought
I’d never have to see you again.
LEIGH
(not what she wanted)
Oh...
CONNER
But I was also... I was a little
disappointed. Like I was missing *
out on something... special. *
LEIGH (CONT'D)
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 79.
LEIGH
(happy)
Oh...
CONNER *
It’s been a long time since I felt *
like that. *
LEIGH *
(beat) *
You know it’s been over an hour and
nothing horrible has happened.
CONNER
Shhhh... don’t jinx it.
Leigh smiles and they continue walking.
110 110 EXT. CAFE - DAY
Brad and Erin are STILL sitting there.
ERIN
There’s no way this could work.
BRAD
I know.
ERIN
Our best friends hate each other.
BRAD
I know.
ERIN
And you and I hate each other.
BRAD
I don’t know about hate.
ERIN
We certainly don’t like each other. *
BRAD
FoodieFan and SingleSurfer do. I *
mean, at least I think they do.
ERIN
(a small smile)
They do.
(smile fades)
But that’s not real life.
(MORE)
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 80.
That’s bits and bytes and data and

ERIN (CONT'D)
(MORE)
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 80A.
And even if they were, we don’t
know if they could’ve worked.
There is another one of those ugly silences.
BRAD
So...
ERIN
So...
Brad takes his jacket and stands up.
BRAD
I’m going to go.
Erin stands up also.
ERIN
Yeah. Me too.
They stand there for a moment and then start to walk away
from each other. Brad stops and turns back.
BRAD
For the record?
Erin stops and turns back.
BRAD (CONT’D)
I think SingleSurfer and FoodieFan *
would’ve worked.
Brad leaves and Erin watches him go for a moment. Then she
turns to leave as well.
111 111 DATE MONTAGE OF SCENES #3
We see a series of brief shots of Leigh and Conner on their
date. It is going a lot better than then one we saw in the
last couple of montages.
1) Conner and Leigh are sitting on a bench in a park, talking
and enjoying each others’ company.
2) Conner and Leigh are eating at a restaurant, laughing and
sharing food off each others’ plates.
3) It is night now as the two of them walk down a sidewalk by
the waterfront. He reaches out to take her hand.

Allison is working late when her phone rings. She answers
it.
ALLISON

QUICK CUT TO:
114 114 INT. MILO’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Milo is on the other end of the line. We begin INTERCUTTING
between the two of them.
MILO
Working late as usual.
ALLISON
Just making sure that everything is
in order for when you come to work
at The Richards Review.
MILO
(smiles)
What a coincidence. I was just
trying to figure out where you’re
going to sit when you come to work
for The Peters Post.
ALLISON
(laughs)
I do enjoy our little chats.
MILO
So do I. Are we really going to do
this? Merge our two companies?
ALLISON
I’ve run all the numbers ten times
and I keep coming up with the same
answer. We’ll be better together
than we are apart.
MILO
We always were.
82.
ALLISON
(sighs)
Milo...
MILO
I know. Sorry. So you’re really
ready to let it go?
ALLISON
(beat - serious)
I have been doing this for a long
time. I started this as a blog
before anyone really knew what a
blog was. It’s been my life.
MILO
I know. I saw it every day when I
worked there. How important it is
to you.
ALLISON
Yes, it is. But when Leigh said
the stakes weren’t high enough for
me, I realized she was right. They
haven’t been for awhile. Things
here have been... routine.
MILO
(tries to be helpful)
You switched to half-caf.
ALLISON
(smiles)
When the thought of betting the
Richards Review popped into my
head, my first reaction wasn’t
“That’s ridiculous” it was “Why
don’t I think that’s ridiculous?”
(beat)
I wouldn’t have made this bet if I
wasn’t prepared, at least on some
level, to lose.
MILO
(beat)
Okay.
ALLISON
But I’m going to win.
MILO
(laughs)
Okay.
83.
ALLISON
And how are you going to feel when
that happens?
MILO
(beat)
Let’s just say you’re not the only
one looking for a change in
routine.
Allison nods and leans back in her chair to put her feet up
on her desk.
ALLISON
So we should probably talk about
logistics.
MILO
Yeah, absolutely.
Milo puts his feet up on his desk as well.
115 115 EXT. RICHARDS REVIEW OFFICES - NIGHT
Conner and Leigh walk up to the Richards Review building, her
arm looped in his.
CONNER
Here we are. Are you sure you
don’t want me to take you home?
LEIGH
My car is here, so...
CONNER
Right.
LEIGH
I could give you a ride.
CONNER
No, I drove here. I’m good.
LEIGH
Okay.
(beat)
I had a great time.
CONNER
So did I.
There is a beat as they stand there, smiling shyly.
84.
CONNER (CONT’D)
So the date is officially over,
right?
LEIGH
Right.
CONNER
So that means...
LEIGH
What?
CONNER
We’re not “Bad Dates.”
Leigh smiles broadly and puts her hand up for a high five.
He gives her one and they show off like they have just scored
a touchdown.
LEIGH
Yeah, buddy! That’s what I’m
talking about!
CONNER
We crushed dating!
LEIGH
(does a little dance)
We’re good at dating! We’re good
at dating!
CONNER
In your face, bad dates!
There is another moment of celebration and then they return
to the shy smiles.
LEIGH
So I have an idea... *
CONNER *
Okay... *
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 85.
LEIGH *
I know this date was for us and not *
for our blogs but... *
CONNER
But it was a really good date. *
LEIGH
It was, wasn’t it?
CONNER
Yes. You think we should tell *
people about it? *
LEIGH
Yes! I would love people to read *
about a good date for once. *
CONNER
Okay, it’s a deal then. Write it *
up tonight and we’ll turn them in *
first thing tomorrow?
LEIGH
Great! I can’t wait to read it.
CONNER
Me too.
LEIGH
Well... good night.
CONNER
Good night.
There is a moment when it appears that Conner is going to
lean in to kiss her, but she holds out her hand to gently
stop him.
LEIGH
If we write up tonight’s date for
our sites, that means it was for
work. I want our first good night
kiss to be after a real date.
CONNER
(smiles)
We get to have a real date?
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 86.
LEIGH
Well, we’re so good at it. It
would be a waste of all this dating
talent not to.
She smiles and walks away. He smiles as he watches her go.

Leigh enters the apartment floating on cloud nine. Erin is
on the couch and no cloud whatsoever.
LEIGH
Okay, you are never going to
believe the incredible day I have
had. Seriously, it’s like I lost
all my bad dating karma.
Leigh finally sees a visibly upset Erin and goes to her
quickly.
LEIGH (CONT’D)
Erin? What’s wrong?
ERIN
I think I found all your bad dating
karma.
LEIGH
What happened?
QUICK CUT TO:
118 118 INT. CONNER’S KITCHEN - NIGHT
Conner and Brad are sitting at the kitchen table in Conner’s
house.
CONNER
Erin? Leigh’s Erin? Your mystery
Internet soul mate was the woman
that, like, kind of hates you?
BRAD
That’s the one.
87.
CONNER
Oh man, I’m sorry.
BRAD
(shrugs)
What are you gonna do?
QUICK CUT TO:
119 119 INT. LEIGH AND ERIN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Leigh and Erin are still on the sofa.
ERIN
I can’t do anything. We’d
obviously never work out, so...
LEIGH
But you said you were really
hitting it off online.
ERIN
That’s before I knew who he really
was.
QUICK CUT TO:
120 120 INT. CONNER’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

I just wish there was a way to show

with Leigh?

Leigh and Erin on the couch.
LEIGH
Incredible! We had the best time.
ERIN
Really?

LEIGH
Really. It’s amazing how much
easier dating is when there are no
crazy people trying to mess it all
up.
QUICK CUT TO:
122 122 INT. CONNER’S KITCHEN - NIGHT
Conner and Brad at the table.
BRAD
Milo Peters and Allison Richards
working together? I thought they
hated each other.
CONNER
Apparently they found something in
common. Greed. Our posts about
our horrible dates have been
getting huge numbers so it makes
sense that they wanted more.
BRAD
So what are you going to do?
QUICK CUT TO:
123 123 INT. LEIGH AND ERIN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Leigh and Erin on the couch.
LEIGH
We’re going to give them what they
asked for... a third date.

124 124 INT. ALLISON’S OFFICE - DAY
Leigh is sitting nervously in the guest chair in Allison’s
office while Allison reads a draft of the new date post on
her computer. She finishes and sits back in her chair.
ALLISON
Okay... Where do I start?
LEIGH
I’m sorry?
89.
ALLISON
You don’t have to apologize...
LEIGH
No, I meant you. You’re sorry.
For intentionally trying to ruin
our dates. You’re sorry for that,
right?
ALLISON
Uh... yes?
LEIGH
Allison...
ALLISON
Your Bad Date Chronicles generated
millions of hits and as far as
revenue, I don’t think the
accounting department has ever been
asked to count that high. So no,
I’m not sorry that we created
something popular and successful.
LEIGH
Even if it meant I got hurt in the
process.
ALLISON
How did you get hurt?
LEIGH
I was on fire!
ALLISON
You really need to let that go,
Leigh. Everyone else has.
LEIGH
Well, it’s over now. You have your
final date piece so I have
fulfilled my duties.
ALLISON
(points to computer)
We can’t run this.
LEIGH
Why not?

ALLISON
(reads from the screen)
“It’s easy to get distracted by the
things that don’t really matter but
that’s what makes it all the more
exciting... when you can see past
those distractions to find the real
person standing behind them...”
(beat)
Erin already pitched a Love Stories *
blog, remember? We don’t do *
fiction? *
LEIGH
It’s not fiction. It’s what *
happened. You’d prefer that I make *
something up? Say we had a
horrible time and there was, like,
a plague of locusts or something?
ALLISON
Well, plague of locusts is a little
far fetched, but I like where
you’re going. Oh, maybe the
restaurant had cockroaches or...
Leigh stands.
LEIGH
I’m not doing this. That’s the
date we had. If you want something
else, write it yourself.
Leigh walks out of the office. Allison fumes for a moment. *
ALLISON

All right. I will.
She turns to the computer and starts typing.

MILO
(beat)
So Allison really tried to sabotage
your dates?
CONNER
Milo...
MILO
(sighs)
Okay, okay. We’re awful people. I
get it. But we had a good reason
for it.
CONNER
You did?
MILO
Yes. Money.
Conner starts to stand up to leave.
MILO (CONT’D)
Just... sit down.
Conner does, warily.
MILO (CONT’D)
What I meant is money for the
company... you know, to pay
people’s salaries with. Not just
mine and yours but everyone who
works here. I’m responsible for
all of these people and sometimes
that is a little...
CONNER
Scary?
MILO
What am I? Nine years old? No,
it’s not scary.
Conner gets up to leave again.
MILO (CONT’D)
Sit, sit, sit...
Conner sits down again reluctantly.
MILO (CONT’D)
It’s... intimidating. I feel the
weight of that responsibility every
single day and...
(MORE)
92.
I guess it made me a little crazy.
(beat)
I am sorry.
CONNER
(beat)
Thank you.
MILO
(holds up Conner’s story)
This is really well written. You
really like her, don’t you?
CONNER
(smiles)
I do.
MILO
It’s totally not what the readers
want.
CONNER
I don’t know... doesn’t everyone
want a happy ending?
MILO
For themselves, yes. For other
people?
(shrugs)
But if this is what you want to
publish...
CONNER
It is.
MILO
(beat)
Then this is what we publish. Just
let me show it to Allison first,
okay? I don’t want there to be any
surprises.
CONNER
Okay. Thanks Milo. I appreciate
it.

Remember that when we’re all
unemployed.

Oh this is good... this is really,
really good.
(laughs again)
This makes the whole fire thing
look like child’s play.
(nods)
Bad Date Chronicles, here we come.
She sets down the paper and turns to the computer and types a
few strokes on the keyboard.
ALLISON (CONT’D)
(reads)
Publish yes or no?
She raises her finger to bring it down on the key that will
publish it but then stops.
The smile on Allison’s face fades and then she lowers her
hand.
She lets out a big sigh and sits back in her chair, staring
at the screen for a moment. Then she reaches up and hits a
key.
ALLISON (CONT’D)
No.
She picks up the printed piece and tosses it in the trash can
next to her desk. A couple of the pages miss and fall on the
floor.
Allison gets up and heads toward the door just as Milo
enters.
ALLISON (CONT’D)
Milo. Hey...
MILO
Hey. Can we talk?
94.
ALLISON
Yes. We actually need to. But I
have to go find Leigh, real quick.
Do you mind waiting?
MILO
No, not at all. Go ahead. I’ll be
here.
ALLISON
Thanks.
Allison exits and Milo goes to sit in the guest chair.
It is here that he notices the papers on the floor next to
the trash can. He goes to pick them up and notices what is
written on them. Milo grabs the rest of the paper from the
floor and trash can and reads quickly, growing more and more
upset.
129 129 INT. CONNER AND BRAD’S OFFICE - DAY
Conner is by himself in the office, working at his computer
when Milo comes in. He hands Conner the sheets of paper he
found in Allison’s office.

You need to read this.
Conner takes them and starts reading.
DISSOLVE TO:
130 130 INT. CONNER AND BRAD’S OFFICE - LATER
Conner has finished reading and sets the papers down on his
desk. He appears shell-shocked - like he has just witnessed
some horrible tragedy.
CONNER
I don’t understand.
MILO
Conner...
CONNER
This is not... it’s not her.
MILO
Everything matches with what you
said only instead of your romantic
comedy she wrote a horror movie.
95.
Milo reads from the paper.
MILO (CONT’D)
“When he asked me if I thought I
would have wanted to go out with
him again after the first date, I
almost couldn’t decide if I wanted
to scream, laugh, run away, or
throw up. That I kept myself from
doing any of those things is
nothing short of a miracle.”
CONNER
Why would she do this?
MILO
I’m sorry to say it, but I think
she played you. This way she gets
to write the Bad Date Chronicles *
and you look like a fool. Then the
Richards Review gets all the hits
and we are left with nothing.
CONNER
(beat)
I really thought she liked me.
MILO
I’m sorry, man.
Conner sits there for a moment, devastated. Then he looks at
Milo.
CONNER
You haven’t published my story yet,
have you?
MILO
No.
CONNER
Good. I think it needs a few
revisions.
Conner turns to the computer and starts typing.

132 132 EXT. RICHARDS REVIEW OFFICES ROOFTOP - DAY
Erin is by herself at a table eating lunch when her tablet
computer gives the telltale “ding” that a message has been
received.
She picks up the tablet to read the “PRIVATE CHAT.” *
SINGLESURFER87: You’re the editor for the food blog, right? *
Erin hesitates for a moment but then decides to respond.
FOODIEFAN88: Yes. *
SINGLESURFER87: I have a problem that I need some advice on.
FOODIEFAN88: You have a food problem? *
SINGLESURFER87: Sort of... I can’t eat when I’m this unhappy. *
Erin smiles and is then surprised when Brad speaks - he is by
the door texting on his phone.
BRAD
I always lose my appetite when I *
feel like I messed up something *
important. *
ERIN
(types and talks)
Maybe you didn’t mess it up. Maybe
someone else messed it up. *
Puts away the phone.
BRAD
Maybe we both did. But I’m
presuming you heard about Conner
and Leigh’s date last night...
ERIN
Yes. It went great.
BRAD
So I figured if the two of them
could let bygones be bygones and
start over, maybe we could, too?
Erin considers, then types something on the computer. Brad’s
phone dings and he looks at it.
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 97.
BRAD (CONT’D)
(reads)
What time are you picking me up
tonight?
Brad smiles and starts to type back a response but her
computer “dings” before he has a chance to finish. Erin
looks up at him.
BRAD (CONT’D)
(shrugs)
Wasn’t me.
Erin looks back at her computer.
ERIN
Oh, it’s a news alert. Conner just
posted his write up of the date!
Brad comes to the table to read over her shoulder. Their
expressions grow grim quickly.
BRAD
Oh no...
ERIN
(reads)
“It turns out that our bad dates
really were my fault because I’m
the one who was willing to give her
the benefit of the doubt. I was
willing to believe that she was a
decent human being.”
Erin looks a Brad.
ERIN (CONT’D)
Did you know about this?
BRAD
No! The last time I talked to him
it was fine. It was great. They
had a great time.
ERIN
Or maybe he was just pretending
that so he could write this hit
piece and steal all the attention.
BRAD
Conner is not like that.
98.
ERIN
And what about you? Coming up here
all charming... I’m such an idiot.
Erin grabs her purse and heads for the door.
BRAD
Where are you going?
ERIN
I have to find Leigh!
Erin exits quickly leaving Brad alone to try to figure out
what just happened.
133 133 EXT. LEIGH AND ERIN’S APARTMENT - DAY
Establishing shot of Leigh and Erin’s apartment building.
134 134 INT. LEIGH AND ERIN’S APARTMENT - DAY
Erin rushes in to find Leigh sitting on the couch. She has a
tablet computer in her lap and a blank expression on her
face. Erin goes to sit by her and they are silent for a
moment.
LEIGH
It’s funny.
ERIN
What is?
LEIGH
How fast it all comes back. I
really didn’t think I had gotten
over the breakup... with Danny...
ERIN
(shocked)
You said his name.
LEIGH
(shrugs)
That’s the thing. I didn’t want to
say his name because I thought it
would hurt too much. I thought I
was still too hurt by everything
that happened.
ERIN
That’s understandable...
99.
LEIGH
But see, I wasn’t. I was better.
I felt better. About myself, about
my life, about everything... I just
didn’t realize it. Until I read
this...
She hands the tablet computer to Erin.
LEIGH (CONT’D)
And now I know how much better I
was... because now I remember what
being hurt really felt like. It *
comes back so fast.
She starts to cry.
LEIGH (CONT’D)
It’s funny, isn’t it?
Erin puts her arm around Leigh’s shoulder and pulls her close
for comfort.
135 135 EXT. PETERS POST OFFICES - NIGHT
Establishing the Peters Post offices.
136 136 INT. MILO’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Milo is at his desk when Allison comes storming in. She
throws print outs of Conner’s article on his desk.
ALLISON
You were just waiting for an
opportunity to stab me in the back,
weren’t you?
Milo stands and comes around the desk to meet her.
MILO
Wait! Somehow you’re the victim?
I really have to give you credit.
That whole “I’m prepared to lose”
stuff was some award-winning
acting.
ALLISON
So let me guess... Conner’s
character assassination piece was
all your idea, right?
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 100.
MILO
The same way Leigh’s hatchet job
was your idea?
ALLISON
What are you talking about? We
haven’t posted anything.
MILO
Yeah, but I saw what you were going
to post.
He pulls out the pieces of paper he took from Allison’s
office and hands them to her.
ALLISON
(shocked)
Oh no... Leigh didn’t write this, I
did.
MILO
What?
ALLISON
Leigh wrote this really lovely,
sweet... And I didn’t want her to
post it. So I wrote this and was
going to put it up instead. But I
changed my mind!
MILO
I don’t believe you.
ALLISON
Where did you find these papers,
Milo?
MILO
(beat)
In the trash.
ALLISON
Because that’s where I put them! I
threw them away! I wasn’t going to
post this.
Milo sits down heavily in one of the guest chairs.
MILO
(mortified)
Conner’s original piece was about
how amazing their date was last
night. And then I showed your
pages to him.
101.
Allison sits down in the other chair next to him.
ALLISON
Of course you did.
MILO
We are terrible people.
ALLISON
The absolute worst.
MILO
They might have been in love.
ALLISON
Or at least heading that way.
MILO
And we ruined it.
ALLISON
Horrible, terrible people.
MILO
So how do we fix it?
They both sit there, stumped.
137 137 INT. CONNER AND BRAD’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Brad is working alone in their office when Allison and Milo
show up.
MILO
Brad... we need your help.
Milo walks over and hands him to separate pieces of paper.
Brad looks at one for a second and then other.
BRAD
What did you two do?
QUICK CUT TO:
138 138 INT. LEIGH AND ERIN’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Erin is working alone in her office when Brad, Milo, and
Allison arrive.
BRAD
Erin...
102.
ERIN
Brad? Get out.
(sees Milo)
And you! Get out, too.
(to Allison)
And you! Well, you own the place
so I can’t tell you to get out, but
I’m not very happy with you either.
ALLISON
That’s fair.
BRAD
Erin, just look at these.
Brad hands her the two sheets of paper. Erin takes them
reluctantly and starts to read one, then the other. She
looks up at Brad.
ERIN
(to Brad)
What did you do?
BRAD
I didn’t do anything!
ALLISON
We did it. It’s our fault. We
just need to figure out how to make
it better.
MILO
What do we say to them that can fix
this?
Erin considers it for a moment, then smiles.
ERIN
We don’t say anything...
Allison, Milo, and Brad are intrigued.
139 139 INT. LEIGH AND ERIN’S OFFICE - NIGHT
It is later that night and the office is empty as Leigh
enters.
LEIGH
Erin, I got your message, what...
Leigh realizes that Erin is not there. A note is taped to
Leigh’s computer reading “On the roof.”
103.
Leigh sighs and exits the office.
140 140 INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
Brad and Conner are on the elevator as it goes up.
CONNER
I still don’t understand what we’re
doing here.
BRAD
Just trust me, okay?
Conner is still suspicious but quiet for the moment.
141 141 EXT. RICHARDS REVIEW OFFICES ROOFTOP - NIGHT
Brad leads Conner through a door at one end of the roof that
has been transformed from the plain, utilitarian space we saw
earlier into a romantic wonderland. There is a path,
outlined by candles in paper bags, leading from two different
doorways across the roof to where they meet in the center at
a table, set for a romantic dinner. Twinkle lights adorn
various pipes and mechanics and are strung across the top.
Conner stops when he sees all this and Brad moves off to the
side of the path. Milo is a little further down and Allison
and Erin are alongside the path that leads from the other
door.
CONNER
What...?
But he stops when the far door opens and Leigh steps out.
She is stunned, especially when she sees Conner.
Erin pulls out a piece of paper and starts reading from it. *
As she does, Leigh starts walking down the path toward the *
table in the center.
ERIN *
(reads) *
“My date with Conner was
unexpected. Not because it turns *
out that he’s charming and funny. *
I had gotten glimpses of those
qualities on our previous dates.” *
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 104.
On the other end of the roof, Brad takes out a piece of paper *
and starts reading. Conner moves to the center as he does. *
BRAD *
(reads) *
“Leigh’s willingness to throw *
caution to the wind and accept my *
proposal to go out on a spur of the
moment date was probably the
bravest thing I have ever seen
anyone do.” *
We go back to Leigh’s side as Allison takes over. *
ALLISON *
(reads) *
“The date with Conner unexpected *
because it turns out that our
horrible dates really were our
fault. Our scars from past *
relationships meant that we weren’t *
willing to give each other the
benefit of the doubt.”
Over on Conner’s side, Milo is taking over reading. *
MILO *
(reads) *
“But Leigh not only accepted this
folly, she embraced it and took a *
chance that was probably like *
jumping off a very tall bridge with
only a very thin bungee cord
promising a return to normalcy. I
know that’s how it felt for me.”
Milo hands Conner a different piece of paper that he takes *
and reads from just as he reaches the table.
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 105.
CONNER
(reads)
“But here’s the thing about
doubt... It’s just a distraction.
It’s easy to get distracted by the
things that don’t really matter but
that’s what makes it all the more
exciting... when you can see past
those distractions to find the real
person standing behind them. I saw
Conner for the first time last
night... but I’m sure it’s not the
last.”
Leigh steps up to the table to read the end of Conner’s post.
LEIGH
(reads)
“Hands clammy, mouths dry, hearts
pounding, Leigh and I stood
together on the precipice, risking
a fall but eagerly anticipating the
act of falling... and together we
leapt.”
Leigh looks up at Conner.
LEIGH (CONT’D)
You wrote this?
He nods and holds up her post.
CONNER
You?
Leigh nods. They move around the table toward one another.
LEIGH
I have a question.
CONNER
Okay.
LEIGH
Can this count as our first real
date?
CONNER
(smiles)
Sure.
LEIGH
Then why aren’t you giving me that
good night kiss right now?
106.
CONNER
Because I’m not ready to say good
night. But if you insist...
He smiles again, puts his hand on her cheek and gently,
sweetly kisses her.
We slowly PULL BACK to show the full sweep of the rooftop and
then FADE TO BLACK.
TITLE CARD: 3 MONTHS LATER
FADE IN:
142 142 EXT. RICHARDS REVIEW OFFICES - DAY
The offices of the Richards Review, only the sign that has
been on the building is no longer there.
143 143 INT. ALLISON’S OFFICE - DAY
We start with a champagne cork being popped and PULL BACK to
reveal all six of our main characters in Allison’s office
celebrating. They cheer as Allison pours the champagne.
ERIN
A toast. Somebody has to make a
toast.
ALLISON
Conner, you go first.
During the following he references Leigh, then Brad and Erin,
and finally Allison and Milo.
CONNER
Okay. Let’s see... to... new
beginnings, old friends, and
strange bedfellows.
They all laugh.
LEIGH
Wait, wait... I’ve got one. To the *
end of The Bad Date Chronicles and *
the beginning of the Real Love *
Stories column. Non-fiction! *
Conner smiles and leans over to give Leigh a quick kiss.
Brad and Erin do the same.
Blue Rev. (03/28/16) 107.
ALLISON
Okay, enough of this romantic
stuff. The real reason we’re here
celebrating... to the union of the
Richards Review and the Peters Post
- a partnership.
Milo smiles at her. Allison hoists her glass.
ALLISON (CONT’D)
To the Richards & Peters Report!
Milo’s smile fades.
MILO
Wait, what? Why does your name go
first?
ALLISON
We talked about this. Our site has
been around longer.
MILO
Yes, but we have a more engaged
audience.
ALLISON
Since when? Our audience is plenty
engaged!
Leigh and Conner back away from Milo and Allison as they *
continue to bicker.
LEIGH
(quietly to Conner) *
How long until they realize that
they’re in love with each other?
CONNER
Maybe we just need to set them up
on a bad date. *
LEIGH *
Why? *
CONNER *
Because you need a few bad dates to *
know what the really good ones are *
like. *
Leigh smiles and puts her arms around Conner and they kiss. *
FADE TO BLACK
